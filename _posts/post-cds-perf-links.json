Looking into\nthe performance of a large group of production websites gives insights that you\nwouldn't get from just examining a site as a one-off. Patterns start to emerge\nabout common areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>I wanted to publicly share a few high-level groupings based on those patterns,\nand identify a handful of links for each area that contain useful guidance. It's\nby no means exhaustive, but I can say that each of these links contains\nsolutions to a real-world performance issue that we identified during the\nPerformance Review Clinics.</p>\n<h1>Linkdump!</h1>\n<p>Huge thanks go out to all the authors, many of whom I'm lucky enough to work\nwith.</p>\n<h2>Overall Migration/End to End Case Study</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/dev-channel/treebo-a-react-and-preact-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-5e4f450d5299\">A React And Preact Progressive Web App Performance Case Study: Treebo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Loading and Prioritization</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/\">Introduction to HTTP/2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization\">Resource Prioritization â€“ Getting the Browser to Help You</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/\">Deep dive into the murky waters of script loading</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>JavaScript</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/\">Can You Afford It?: Real-world Web Performance Budgets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/reloading/javascript-start-up-performance-69200f43b201\">JavaScript Start-up Performance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CSS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/addyosmani/critical\"><code>critical</code>: Extract &amp; Inline Critical-path CSS in HTML pages</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2016/link-in-body/\">The future of loading CSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/\"><code>loadCss</code>: A function for loading CSS asynchronously</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Caching</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching\">HTTP Caching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/\">Caching best practices &amp; max-age gotchas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/\">Service Workers: an Introduction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/\">Workbox: JavaScript libraries for Progressive Web Apps</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Images/Multimedia Content</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://images.guide/\">Essential Image Optimization</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deanhume.com/home/blogpost/lazy-loading-images-using-intersection-observer/10163\">Lazy Loading Images Using Intersection Observer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/\">Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts [CAGEMATCH]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/content-jumping-avoid/\">Content Jumping (and How To Avoid It)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.labnol.org/internet/light-youtube-embeds/27941/\">A Better Method for Embedding YouTube Videos on your Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
