Don’t use Blink web browsers, especially Chrome.\nGoogle is taking over the web, as soon they fully monopolize the internet they will start dictating the standards and technologies you can use. That means they will tell what can be done on the internet. It will have impact on us and the future generations. It’s already happening. We rely more and more on the internet. And Google is executing their plans consequently step by step. They’re evil, android and chrome did fantastic job for them. They’re the biggest threat to the free web. As long as Firefox is alive we still can have hope to not get into dystopian future. Firefox is the last bastion of the free and open web.<br>\n<br>\nDon’t be evil, use Firefox.<br>\nGod bless.</p>\n",
