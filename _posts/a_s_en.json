Anette was watering her flowers when she heard a \nsound of an incoming phone message. She put the watering can on the\nground and looked on her phone.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Hey Anette, maybe\nwe gonna go out for a party tonight, DJ Plastique will play at The\nDepot.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">He always made her\ngiggle, it’s probably the fifth time he tried picking her up.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- OK, I will be\nready for the evening. - she replied.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tShe had no plans\nanyway, and Sven despite being silly, wasn’t the worst companion.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">* * *</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tClimbing\npoles, standing on jibs, constant, omnipresent smell of blilboard\nglue. Sven had a job at a company mounting ads around the city. When\nhe was back home from work he was having supper, was opening a beer,\nturning on TV and going to bed. Over and over, for last three years\nsince they dropped him out the university.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tHowever\ntoday was different, today he’s going to the club with Anette.\nThere will be music, beer, friends and Anette. That turnes the things\naround, Sven was enjoying the excitement.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">* * *</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Hi!</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Hi…</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tThey\nexchanged few friendly kisses at their chicks. A moment later the cab\nwas already there. Fifteen minutes later they were standing under the\nclub.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tThe\nDepot was theirs. Everyone knew everyone, arguments were rare, one\ncould have fun in peace. After a set of high fives and other forms of\nwelcomes, Anette and Sven ordered beers and sat at a table.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tTrack\nafter track, beer after beer, cigarette after cigarette. Hours\npassed, both of them had enough of the party, it was time to get a\ncab and go back.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">* * *</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tThey\nwent out the cab at Anette’s house. The street light was shining at\nher wooden house and the garden. \n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">-\nAnette… - Sven stuttered.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Yes?</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Anet\nI would like to have you, very…</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tAnette\nlaughed.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- Come\non man, you’re drunk, go back home, we’re just friends.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tSven\nhad enough of this. He works his ass off every single day. Barely\nmanages to live out of it. In addition to this he throws flowers at\nAnette every time he can. He deserves more. Sven feels his blood\nboiling. He grabs her arms hard.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- I\nwant you… - says trough clenched teeth.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tAnetter\ngets overtaken by fear. She gets free out of Sven’s grab and rus at\nthe porch. Opens the door. Enters, and whams the door. Looks outside\na window, Sven is gone already. She hears noise in her head. She got\nenough of alcohol, loud music and Sven. She drops at her bed in her\ncloths. Falls asleep instantly.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">* * *</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tSven\ndecided to simply spend the night at a bench. Alone. He didn’t want\nto get back home. There was a gas station nearby, he went there to\nbuy a few beers. He sat at the bench next to Anette’s house and\nstarted drinking beer. No, it cannot be like this… he was thinking.\nAll of this for nothing, I do whatever I can and more and no one\nwants me anyway…</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tAll\nthe alcohol made him dizzy. He made a decision. He’s gonna take\nAnnete by himself. He deserves it. He wants justice. Gets up from the\nbench, takes last sip of beer and shatters the bottle at asphalt.\nUnstably walks in direction of Anette’s house. Front door are\nclosed. After few yanks he resigns trying to get in.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tThere\nhas to be another way in… he thinks. Goes around the house, enters\nthe garden. The garage door seem to be open, he goes in. He smells a\nnot fresh stink inside and there is a slight fog right above the\nground. \n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- I\nwant you! - shout’s a male voice.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- What\nthe hell… - he asks himself.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tHe\ndecides to get out the room, turns back but when he tries to walk out\nhe sees a man shape in black uniform. That uniform is nothing like he\nseen before, maybe similar to a cosmonaut uniform or perhaps an old\nschool diving uniform. For sure it is thick large and hard, there are\npipes connected to it here and there. When it comes to that it’s\ncovered with a glass cloche that appears to be filled with some sort\nof liquid. And inside he clearly sees a head of an old man with long,\ngray hair. His face seems to have no mimics and only his eyes move.\nHis hards hold something that seem to be a taut rope. In an instant\nmove he entangles Sven’s necks with the rope and hits is stomach\nwith his knee at the same time. Sven can’t get out of this. Sven\ndies.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">* * *</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\"><br/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tFirst\nsun rays wake Anette up. She gets up, her head hurts.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">- What\na hangovers – she speaks to herself.</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tShe\ngets at her computer, checks the messages. There is a message from\nSven. It says:</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">“Thank\nyou for the awesome evening, it was fantastic. Unfortunetly I\nurgently need to travel out the town and we wont be able to do that\nagain. Water those flowers! Ant btw, a cat made birth to kittens next\nto your house!!! Thinks about that too! Bye :*</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%\">\tAnd\nthe birds remained silent this morning.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",
