Well lineages are large, organized\nfamilies. They care about blood, wealth, heath, education, reputation\nof the power of the lineage. They do all they can to improve the\nlineage. Being a member of the lineage is beneficial, you have a lot\nof support from often rich and powerful people. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Lineages\nhave their rules, codex and leadership. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">It\ndoes not take much to start a lineage. But, it takes a lot of time to\nmake the lineage big. Often few hundreds of years. Through that time\nyou constantly have to prove and improve your lineage so it shows up\nan as glorious through the history.</span></p></p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm\"><span lang=\"en-US\">\tThey\nkeep track of all the people they got, what they did, when they were\nborn, died, etc. And by starting a lineage you get the founder\nstatus, you will be remembered as the founder of the lineage, as a\ngreat person. Lineages arrange marriage for young grown ups so\neveryone gets married in a good family. Dowry for a young woman is a\ngreat way to arrange them, every lineage wants their women to be\nmarried in good and wealthy families. </span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm\"><span lang=\"en-US\">\tA\ngood lineage will never leave you alone to die if they are able help.\nAnd it all starts with considering the general prosperity of your\nfamily is most important, when you realize you can make the name mean\nsomething. So yeah families values are a good virtue to have. Very\ngood if you're conscious you're in a family and you should together\nwith the family for mutual benefit. No we should make a lot of\nlineages. After 200 years it will be clear who takes the prime, who's\nthe largest, strongest, most noble, smartest lineage of all lineages.\nAnd this lineage will take power in their hands. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">F</span><span lang=\"en-US\">rom\nthe prime lineage there will be king chosen, the leader of the prime\nlineage. Head of all families in the nation. And everyone in the\nnation will say &quot;hail to the king&quot;.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm\"><span lang=\"en-US\">\tK</span><span lang=\"en-US\">ing\ncould be a good guy. Like, I could go to the king if they let me and\nas him: &quot;sire, i appreciate all of your magnificent country but\nwe're a small group of Muslims and we can't afford to build a little\nmosque, could you build one for us?&quot;. And if king likes me and\nthe idea he just gives an order. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">A</span><span lang=\"en-US\">nd\nthey start building the mosque. So yea I'm big fan of lineage based\nsocieties.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm\">\n<span lang=\"en-US\">\t</span><span lang=\"en-US\">K</span><span lang=\"en-US\">nowledge\nis very important in lineages. Like you learn stuff in a school\nlineage picks up. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">B</span><span lang=\"en-US\">ut\nyou also carry knowledge about lineage itself. Generation after\ngeneration. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">A</span><span lang=\"en-US\">nd\nover time your lineage gets better and better. Like there are larger\nfamilies helping each other but only in a formal lineage you can\norganize your family on a large scale and survive for long. And this\nmakes things more clear, a situation when a distant member of the\nfamily rejects you can't happen. So anyway, those are wise families\noriented to long term survival which is a virtue. </span>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm\"><span lang=\"en-US\">\tE</span><span lang=\"en-US\">lders\nlive their late life with dignity. Kids get the best education\npossible. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Th</span><span lang=\"en-US\">e\nblood improves.<br/>\nYou can live in New York and have lineage\nmembers all over </span><span lang=\"en-US\">your</span><span lang=\"en-US\">\ncountry, like in San Francisco or Chicago. So there is always someone\nto hang around with when you travel. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">A</span>fter\nlineage grows you can have relatives in all kinds of places,\nmilitary, medicine, corporations, police, cinematography, everywhere!\nLineages are pure good, start one now!</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",
